# Declare a function called test1
test1:
  # Has a list of params, and their types
  params:
    # param called x
    x: number
  # Returns a number
  return: number
  # The code of the function, start index at 0
  code:
    # var looks up the variable from the known symbols and pushes it
    - ["var", "x"]
    - ["push", 2]
    - mul
    - ["push", 3]
    - add
    - return
    # This "return" takes the top of the stack and puts it into the return register
    # It doesn't actually make the function exit
